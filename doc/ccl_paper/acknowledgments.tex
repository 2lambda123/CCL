%In addition
We would like to thank the organisers of the the DESC collaboration meetings at: Oxford (July 2016), SLAC (Ferurary 2018, March 2016), and ANL (2015), and the LSST-DESC Hack Week organisers (CMU, November 2016), where this work 
was partly developed. We would also like to acknowledge the contribution of the participants of the TJP Code Comparison Project, some of whom are among the \ccl contributors, for providing the benchmarks for testing CCL. We also acknowledge Louis Penafiel and Elizabeth Kimura, who developed the {\tt VARRIC} code to compare and visualize power spectra calculated by {\tt CCL} and {\tt CLASS}. Finally, we are grateful for the feedback received from other working groups of DESC, including Strong Lensing, Supernovae and Photometric Redshifts.
