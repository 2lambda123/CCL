## Editing this Paper

Fork and/or clone the project repo, and then
edit the primary file. The name of this file will vary according to its format, but it should be one of either `main.rst` (if it's a [`reStructuredText`](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) Note), `main.md` (if it's a [`Markdown`](https://github.com/adam-p/Markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) Note), `main.ipynb` (if it's an [`IPython Notebook`](https://ipython.org/notebook.html)) or `main.tex` (if it's a latex Note or paper).
Please use the `figures` folder for your images.

## Building this Paper

GitHub is our primary distributor for LSST DESC Notes:
once the Note has been merged into the project repo's master branch, it will be visible as a *shared* (but not *published*) paper. The presentation of Notes will be improved later, as the LSST DESC Publication System evolves.

Automatically building latex-format Notes or journal articles into PDF files is not yet supported but hopefully will be soon.
You can compile latex papers locally with
```
make  [note|apj|apjl|prd|prl|mnras]
```
